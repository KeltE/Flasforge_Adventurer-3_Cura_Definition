# Cura settings for Flashforge Adventurer 3

Installation Instructions

Since I'm using windows, other operating systems don't know the correct location.
Copy the "adventurer3Cura" "recourses" and "plugin" directory to the Cura installation location.
For example:
Windows 10:  C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0\

Other operating systems must also have the same folder somewhere.
\Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0\

The printer appears under the "Flasforge3" manufacturer.

# Added Ronoaldo .GX plugin.
